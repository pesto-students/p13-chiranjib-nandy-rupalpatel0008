  <p>
    I'm Nobody! Who are you?
    <br>
    Are you - Nobody - Too?
    <br>
    Then there's a pair of us!
    <br>
    Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
  </p>
  <p>
    How dreary - to be - Somebody!
    <br>
    How public - like a Frog -
    <br>
    To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!
  </p>
  <p>
    By Emily Dickinson (1891)
